      Bytecode is executed by the JVM. The output of the Java compiler is
      bytecode, which leads to the security and portability of the Java code. It
      is a highly developed set of instructions that are designed to be executed
      by the Java runtime system known as Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The Java
      programs executed by the JVM that makes the code portable and secure.
      Because JVM prevents the code from generating its side effects. The Java
      code is portable, as the same byte code can run on any platform.

      The Java language does not support pointers; some of the major reasons are
      listed below: One of the major factors of not using pointers in Java is
      security concerns. Due to pointers, most of the users consider C-language
      very confusing and complex. This is the reason why Green Team (Java Team
      members) has not introduced pointers in Java. Java provides an effective
      layer of abstraction to the developers by not using pointers in Java. Java
      is dynamic, architecture-neutral, and object-oriented programming
      language.

      Unicode escape sequence.</br>
       In Java, Unicode characters can be used in string
      literals, comments, and commands, and are expressed by Unicode Escape
      Sequences. A Unicode escape sequence is made up of the following articles:
      A backslash '\' (ASCII character 92) A 'u' (ASCII 117) One or more
      additional 'u' characters that are optional. A four hexadecimal digits (a
      character from 0 - 9 or a-f or A-F)
    </p>
    <p>The Java Debugger (JDB or jdb) is a command-line java debugger that debugs the java class. It is a part of the Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA) that helps in the inspections and debugging of a local or remote Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

      The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) enables a computer to run Java or other language (kotlin, groovy, Scala, etc.) programs that are compiled to the Java bytecode. The JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is a part of JDK that contains the Java class libraries, Java class loader, and the Java Virtual Machine. The JDK (Java Development Kit) is a software development environment used to develop Java applications and applets.</p>
    
    
    <p>A char literal may contain a Unicode character (UTF-16). We can directly use these characters only if our file system allows us, else use a Unicode escape (\u) such as "\u02tee". The char literals are always declared in single quotes (').

      The option b, c, and d, are not valid because:
      
      In the option b), to make a String valid char literal, we should add prefix "\u" in the string.
      In the option c), single quotes are not present.
      In the option d), "\i" is used in place of "\u."</p>
    
    
    
    <p>In Java, the return type of hashCode() method is an integer, as it returns a hash code value for the object.</p>
    <p>For every long literal to be recognized by Java, we need to add L character at the end of the expression. It can be either uppercase (L) or lowercase (l) character. However, it is recommended to use uppercase character instead of lowercase because the lowercase (l) character is hard to distinguish from the uppercase (i) character.

      For example,
      
      Lowercase l: 0x466rffl
      Uppercase L: 0nhf450L</p>
    <p>++z means that the value will first increment by 1, i.e. 12. Now, evaluate the statement by putting the values of x, y, and z. On evaluating the expression, we get 25, as shown below.

      ++z +y -y +z + x++
      11 + 5 - 5 + 11 + 3 = 25</p>
